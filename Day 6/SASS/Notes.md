"Sass" can refer to a few different things:

1. **Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets**: This is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It allows for variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. This makes writing and maintaining CSS easier and more efficient.

2. **Sass (software)**: It's also the name of the software that interprets Sass code and converts it into CSS. There are two syntaxes available for Sass: the older, original syntax called "Sass" (indented syntax), and the newer, more commonly used syntax called "SCSS" (Sassy CSS) which uses block formatting like CSS. Both syntaxes are supported by the Sass interpreter.

  Sass is a tool used in web development to streamline the process of writing and managing CSS stylesheets, offering features that are not available in standard CSS. These features include variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and more, which can significantly improve the efficiency and maintainability of stylesheets.


**What is Sass?**

Sass is an extension to CSS
Sass is a CSS pre-processor

**Why Use Sass?**
Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

**Sass Variables**
Variables are a way to store information that you can re-use later.

With Sass, you can store information in variables, like:

strings
numbers
colors
booleans
lists
nulls
