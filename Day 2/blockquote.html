    <p>A Great Motivational Quote :</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/erin_cummings">
      <p>
        At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and
        your failure. And the sooner you realize that, you accept that, and
        integrate that into your work ethic, you will start being successful. As
        long as you blame others for the reason you aren't where you want to be,
        you will always be a failure.
      </p>
