
 ### Key Differences:

 1. **What they iterate over:**
    - `for...in` iterates over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object.
    - `for...of` iterates over the values of an iterable object.

2. **Order of iteration:**
   - `for...in` does not guarantee the order of iteration for the properties of an object.
    - `for...of` guarantees the order of iteration based on the iterable object.

 3. **Use cases:**
    - Use `for...in` when you need to iterate over the properties of an object.
   - Use `for...of` when you need to iterate over the values of an iterable object.

 In summary, use `for...in` for objects, and `for...of` for iterable objects like arrays and strings. Each has its own use case and is suited for specific scenarios.
