// Declarative programming, on the other hand, is a style where the code expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. It focuses on "what" needs to be done rather than "how" to do it. Declarative code tends to be more concise and abstracts away implementation details.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers);
