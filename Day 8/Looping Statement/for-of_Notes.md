No, the `for...of` loop in JavaScript is specifically designed for iterating over iterable objects, and it cannot be used directly with regular objects (plain objects) because objects are not inherently iterable.

The `for...of` loop is intended for use with objects that implement the iterable protocol, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and other iterable data structures. Iterable objects have a well-defined iteration behavior, and they provide an iterator object that is used by the `for...of` loop to retrieve values in a sequence.

For example, you can use `for...of` with an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

for (const number of numbers) {
  console.log(number); // Outputs: 1, 2, 3
}
```

If you attempt to use `for...of` with a regular object, you'll encounter an error:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  job: 'developer'
};

// This will result in an error
for (const value of person) {
  console.log(value);
}
```

To iterate over the properties of an object, you should use the `for...in` loop:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  job: 'developer'
};

for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]); // Outputs: name: John, age: 30, job: developer
}
```

If you want to iterate over the values of an object, you can use `Object.values()`:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  job: 'developer'
};

const values = Object.values(person);
for (const value of values) {
  console.log(value); // Outputs: John, 30, developer
}
```

In summary, `for...of` is not used directly with regular objects, but it is a powerful construct for iterating over values in iterable objects. Use `for...in` or other methods when working with the properties of regular objects.
