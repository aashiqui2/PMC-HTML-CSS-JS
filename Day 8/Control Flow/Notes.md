Certainly! Let's delve into each of these programming constructs in detail.

### Conditional Statements (if, else if, else):

Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

#### `if` statement:
```javascript
let condition = true;

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

#### `else if` statement:
```javascript
let condition1 = false;
let condition2 = true;

if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if both conditions are false
}
```

### Switch Statements:

The `switch` statement is used to evaluate an expression against multiple possible case values. It provides an alternative to a series of `if` and `else if` statements.

```javascript
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("It's the start of the week!");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("Weekend is approaching!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("It's a regular day.");
}
```

### Looping Structures (for, while, do-while):

#### `for` loop:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

#### `while` loop:
```javascript
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition (i < 5) is true
    i++;
}
```

#### `do-while` loop:
```javascript
let i = 0;

do {
    // Code to be executed at least once, and then as long as the condition (i < 5) is true
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

### Break and Continue Statements:

#### `break` statement:
The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

#### `continue` statement:
The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop's code for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        continue; // Skip the rest of the loop's code for i equals 2
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

Understanding and effectively using these control flow structures is fundamental to writing flexible and powerful JavaScript code. They enable you to handle different scenarios and control the flow of your program based on conditions and loops.
