In web development, `e.preventDefault()` is a method commonly used in JavaScript to prevent the default behavior of an event. 

When you interact with elements on a webpage, such as clicking on a link or submitting a form, the browser typically performs some default action associated with that event. For example, clicking on a link will navigate you to the URL specified in the anchor tag's `href` attribute, or submitting a form will cause the browser to send a request to the server.

However, there might be cases where you want to override this default behavior and handle the event differently using JavaScript. `e.preventDefault()` is a method that allows you to do just that.

Here's how it works:

1. You attach an event listener to an HTML element, such as a button or a link.
2. When the specified event (e.g., click, submit) occurs, the associated JavaScript function is triggered.
3. Inside this function, you can call `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the default behavior of the event from occurring.

Here's an example:

```javascript
document.getElementById("myLink").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // This prevents the default behavior of clicking on a link
    alert("Link clicked, but default behavior prevented.");
});
```

In this example, when a user clicks on the link with the id `myLink`, instead of navigating to the URL specified in the `href` attribute, an alert will pop up, indicating that the link was clicked, but the default behavior was prevented.

This method is commonly used in scenarios where you want to perform some custom action before allowing the browser to carry out its default behavior.
