`innerText` and `textContent` are both properties in JavaScript used to manipulate the text content of an HTML element, but they have some differences in their behavior:

1. **`innerText`**:
   - `innerText` returns the visible text content of an element, i.e., the text that is rendered on the screen.
   - It respects CSS styling and will not return the text if it's hidden by CSS (`display: none`) or affected by CSS styling.
   - It is not supported in Firefox for table cells (`<td>`) and line breaks (`<br>`).
   - It is more aware of style and layout and can be slower than `textContent`.

Example:

```html
<div id="exampleDiv" style="display: none;">Hello, world!</div>
<script>
  console.log(document.getElementById('exampleDiv').innerText); // Output: ''
</script>
```

2. **`textContent`**:
   - `textContent` returns all the text content of an element, including hidden text and text within script and style elements.
   - It represents the text content of all elements, regardless of CSS styling.
   - It is supported across all browsers and doesn't have any browser compatibility issues like `innerText`.
   - It's generally faster and more predictable compared to `innerText`.

Example:

```html
<div id="exampleDiv" style="display: none;">Hello, world!</div>
<script>
  console.log(document.getElementById('exampleDiv').textContent); // Output: 'Hello, world!'
</script>
```

In summary, if you need to access the visible text content of an element and want it to behave consistently across browsers, `innerText` might be preferable. However, if you need to access all the text content of an element regardless of visibility or styling, `textContent` is the better choice.
