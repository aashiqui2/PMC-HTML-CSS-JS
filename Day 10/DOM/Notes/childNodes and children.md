In the Document Object Model (DOM), the terms "childNodes" and "children" refer to different properties that allow you to access the child nodes of a particular node.

1. **childNodes**:
   - `childNodes` is a property of the DOM Node interface which returns a collection of child nodes for a given node. 
   - This collection includes all types of nodes, such as element nodes, text nodes, comment nodes, etc.
   - The `childNodes` property returns a NodeList, which is an array-like object but not exactly an array, so it doesn't have array methods like `forEach`, `map`, etc. However, you can iterate through it using a loop or convert it to an array using `Array.from()` or `Array.prototype.slice.call()`.

2. **children**:
   - `children` is also a property of the DOM Node interface, but it returns a collection of element nodes that are direct children of a particular node.
   - Unlike `childNodes`, the `children` property only includes element nodes, ignoring text nodes, comment nodes, etc.
   - The `children` property returns an HTMLCollection, which is similar to a NodeList but specifically for HTML elements. Like NodeList, it's array-like but not an array.

Here's a basic example illustrating the difference:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="parent">
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
  </div>

  <script>
    const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
    
    // Using childNodes
    const childNodes = parent.childNodes;
    console.log(childNodes); // NodeList(5) [text, p, text, p, comment]

    // Using children
    const children = parent.children;
    console.log(children); // HTMLCollection(2) [p, p]
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `childNodes` includes all child nodes of the `parent` div, including text nodes, element nodes (`<p>`), and a comment node. On the other hand, `children` only includes the `<p>` element nodes.
