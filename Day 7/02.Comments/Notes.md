Comments in programming serve several important purposes, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Here are some key reasons why comments are used:

1. **Explanation and Documentation:**
   - **Clarification of Code:** Comments help explain complex logic, algorithms, or business rules in a way that is easy to understand for developers (including the original author or others who may work on the code).
   - **Documentation:** Comments document the purpose, usage, and behavior of functions, classes, and modules.

2. **Debugging and Troubleshooting:**
   - **Debugging Information:** Comments can be used to temporarily remove or disable parts of the code during debugging without deleting it. Developers often use comments to troubleshoot and identify issues.
   - **TODOs and Fixmes:** Comments can indicate areas that need attention, improvements, or fixes in the future. This helps developers track incomplete tasks or known issues.

3. **Collaboration and Communication:**
   - **Communication Among Team Members:** Comments provide a means of communication between team members, especially in collaborative projects where multiple developers are working on the same codebase.
   - **Code Reviews:** Comments are essential during code reviews, as they facilitate communication between team members reviewing the code.

4. **Code Annotations:**
   - **Annotations for Build Tools:** Comments are sometimes used to provide information to build tools or documentation generators. For example, comments can be used to annotate special instructions for tools like linters or documentation generators.
   - **Type Annotations:** In some languages, comments are used to provide type information that might be used by type-checking tools.

5. **Historical Context:**
   - **Change History:** Comments can be used to explain why certain decisions were made or why specific changes were implemented. This provides historical context for the codebase.

6. **Preventing Execution:**
   - **Preventing Code Execution:** Comments can be used to comment out lines or blocks of code temporarily without deleting them. This can be useful for testing alternative implementations or troubleshooting.

### Examples:

```javascript
// Example of a single-line comment
let x = 10; // Variable x is assigned the value 10

/*
  Multi-line comment
  This is a detailed explanation of the function.
*/
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// TODO: Refactor this function for better performance
function optimize() {
  // Implementation details
}

// DEBUG: Temporary logging for troubleshooting
console.log('Debugging information');
```

In summary, comments play a crucial role in making code more understandable, maintainable, and collaborative. However, it's important to use comments judiciously and keep them up to date to ensure their accuracy and relevance.
