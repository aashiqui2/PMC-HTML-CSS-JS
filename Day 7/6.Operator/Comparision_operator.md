In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are two comparison operators used to compare values. However, they behave differently in terms of type coercion.

1. **== (Equality Operator):**
   - The `==` operator compares values for equality after performing type coercion if the operands are of different types.
   - It tries to convert operands to the same type before making the comparison.
   - For example, when comparing a string and a number, the string may be converted to a number before the comparison.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   5 == "5";   // true, because the string "5" is coerced to the number 5
   1 == true;  // true, because the boolean true is coerced to the number 1
   ```

2. **=== (Strict Equality Operator):**
   - The `===` operator, also known as the strict equality operator, compares values for equality without performing type coercion.
   - It checks both the values and their types. If the values are of different types, the comparison returns `false`.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   5 === "5";  // false, because the types are different (number !== string)
   1 === true; // false, because the types are different (number !== boolean)
   ```

In general, it's recommended to use `===` (strict equality) over `==` (equality) in JavaScript because it avoids unexpected type coercion and produces more predictable results. Using strict equality helps to write more robust and bug-resistant code.
