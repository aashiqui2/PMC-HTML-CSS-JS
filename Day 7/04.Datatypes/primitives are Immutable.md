Certainly! The concept that "primitives are immutable" means that the actual values of primitive types cannot be changed once they are assigned. However, it's crucial to distinguish between the variable and the value it holds. Let's go through examples for better clarification:

### Immutable Nature of Primitives:

1. **Strings (Immutable):**

   ```javascript
   let str = 'Hello';
   console.log(str); // Output: Hello

   // Attempting to modify the string (changing a character)
   // This doesn't work because strings are immutable
   // Each operation on a string creates a new string
   str[0] = 'M';

   console.log(str); // Output: Hello
   ```

   Strings are immutable, so attempting to change a character at a specific index will not modify the original string. Instead, a new string will be created.

2. **Numbers (Immutable):**

   ```javascript
   let num = 42;
   console.log(num); // Output: 42

   // Attempting to modify the number
   // This doesn't work because numbers are immutable
   num = 50;

   console.log(num); // Output: 50
   ```

   Numbers, being primitive, are immutable. Assigning a new value to a variable replaces the old value but doesn't modify the original number.

### Variables Assigned Primitive Values:

It's important to note that while the values themselves are immutable, the variables holding these values can be reassigned:

```javascript
let str = 'Hello';
console.log(str); // Output: Hello

// Reassigning the variable to a new string
str = 'World';

console.log(str); // Output: World
```

In this case, the variable `str` is reassigned to a new string value. The original string ('Hello') is no longer accessible through the variable `str`.

So, when we say "primitives are immutable," we mean that the values themselves cannot be changed. Any operation that seems to modify a primitive actually creates a new value. However, variables holding these primitive values can be reassigned to new values.
