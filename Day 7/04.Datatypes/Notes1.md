JavaScript has several built-in data types, which can be categorized into two main groups: primitive data types and object data types.

### Primitive Data Types:

1. **Number:**
   - Represents numeric values.
   - Examples: `5`, `3.14`, `-10`.

2. **String:**
   - Represents sequences of characters.
   - Examples: `'Hello'`, `"JavaScript"`, `` `Template literals` ``.

3. **Boolean:**
   - Represents either `true` or `false`.
   - Used in logical operations and control flow.

4. **Undefined:**
   - Represents an uninitialized or undeclared variable.
   - The default value of variables that are not assigned.

5. **Null:**
   - Represents the absence of any object value.
   - It's an assignment value that represents no value or no object.

6. **Symbol (ES6+):**
   - Represents a unique identifier.
   - Used for creating unique property keys in objects.

### Object Data Types:

7. **Object:**
   - Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   - Used for storing and organizing data.

### Special Data Type:

8. **BigInt (ES6+):**
   - Represents whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1.
   - Created by appending `n` to the end of an integer literal, e.g., `10n`.

### Complex Data Types (Derived from Object):

9. **Array:**
   - Represents an ordered collection of values.
   - Accessed by index.
   - Examples: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['apple', 'banana', 'orange']`.

10. **Function:**
    - Represents a reusable block of code.
    - Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript.

### Understanding Data Types:

- JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any type without explicit type declarations.
- The `typeof` operator can be used to determine the data type of a variable or expression.
